# ![](./assets/intel-4004-ad-photo-gray.jpg){width="504" height="329"} <br/> A micro-programmable computer <br/> on a chip!

Intel introduces an integrated CPU complete with a 4-bit <br/>
parallel adder, sixteen 4-bit registers, an accumulator <br/>
and a push-down stack on one chip. It's one of a family <br/>
of four new ICs which comprise the MCS-4 micro <br/>
computer system--the first system to bring you the <br/>
power and flexibility of a dedicated general-purpose <br/>
computer at low cost in as few as two dual in-line <br/>
packages

MCS-4 systems provide complete computing and <br/>
contral functions for test systems, data terminals, billing <br/>
machines, measuring systems, numeric control systems <br/>
and process control systems.

The heart of any MCS-4 system is a Type 4004 CPU, <br/>
which includes a powerful set of 45 instructions. Adding <br/>
one or more Type 4001 ROMs for program storage <br/>
and data tables gives you a fully functioning micro- <br/>
programmed computer. To this you may add Type 4002 <br/>
RAMs for read-write memory and Type 4003 registers <br/>
to expand the output ports.

Using no circuitry other that ICs from this family of <br/>
four, you can create a system with 4096 8-bit bytes of <br/>
ROM storage and 5120 bits of RAM storage. When <br/>
you require rapid turn-around or need only a few <br/>
systems, Intel's erasable and re-programmable ROM, <br/>
Type 1701, may be substituted for the Type 4001 mask- <br/>
programmed ROM.

MCS-4 systems interface easily with switches, key- <br/>
boards, displays, teletypewriters, printers, readers, A-D <br/>
converters and other popular peripherals.

The MCS-4 family is now in stock at Intel's Santa Clara <br/>
headquarters and at our marketing headquarters in <br/>
Europe and Japan. In the U.S., contact your local Intel <br/>
