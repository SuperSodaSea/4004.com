# The Intel 4004 after 44 years! 2015 Progress Report

## A new foundation for the future: making the inner workings of the microprocessor accessible to students young and old

Team leader [Tim McNerney](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~mcnerney)'s
original goal for starting this project was to make the invisible
machinery of the first computers-on-a-chip visible and understandable
to students and the lay public. The 4004 is great for many reasons,
but for this project it's number one selling point is that it is
a *minimal CPU.* This is extremely useful for teaching purposes.
In the coming months before the 45th anniversary, we will be working
to make the 4004 and fundamentals of computers and digital logic even
more accessible though the confluence of art, education, and
technology. This project could never have been done alone. It needed
an [international team of volunteers.](#credits)


## New: Scalable Vector Mask Artwork for Museum-sized Exhibits

For years, our project made do with mask artwork scanned from an
Intel Archives' set of aging mask proof transparencies. These were
invaluable for making silkscreens for the Intel Museum exhibit's 16x23
inch ["big chip"](./assets/PB150071.JPG) 4004 replica still
on display. Later, with some bitmap scaling, alignment, and careful
corrections, thanks to Lajos Kintli, we succeeded in verifying them
against Fred Huettig's paintstakingly re-captured schematics.

If you look too closely, the old proof set artwork is pretty ugly,
certainly nothing we could use if we wanted to build a larger museum
exhibit, say 3x4 feet, or import the mask artwork into a PCB layout
package to build a giant, working circuit board. The old artwork just
wasn't going to cut it. So McNerney took a pair of high-resolution
photomicrographs (kindly donated by reverse engineer extraordinaire,
Christopher Tarnovski), and set out to trace every wire, transistor,
resistor, and capacitor using Adobe Illustrator. Just hours before
the 44th anniversary, he finished tracing the first, complete draft of
the mask set artwork.

The next step is to verify the mask artwork against the schematics
and try it out in simulation. Right after the announcement we found a
few inevitable omissions (mostly missing vias), using the "eyeball
method," which is what Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima had to do
in 1970 (remember, t'was all "analog" back in the day... see below).
Lajos has just begun to apply his software analyzer/verifier to
compare the new artwork against Fred's schematics, and he has some
obstacles to overcome due to the misalignment of the polysilicon layer
that occured back when our photographed sample chip was
fabricated.

We hope and pray that Intel's lawyers will give us their blessing
to release these high-quality 4004 mask reproductions (even though we
can only make educated guesses on original dimensions, spacing, and
design rules). Optimistically assuming that happens, our intention is
to release the new mask artwork sometime in 2016, probably for
non-commercial use only. The license that Intel routinely grants for
4004 assets is *very* similar to the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA
license that we use on this web site. As entrepreneurs know so well,
"past performance does not guarantee future results," so we need to
remain patiently enthusiastic.

The complete chip: A composite of the mask artwork—six layers in all: metal, polysilicon, diffusion,
vias, buried contacts, and passivation.

## Celebrating the unsung artists of Silicon Valley: Rubylith cutters

Back in the early 1970s, CAD software for chip design was rarely
found outside of large corporations, if at all, design-rule checkers
were people, and Adobe was still just the name of the little creekbed
that ran through my back yard in Los Altos, California. For MSI
(Medium Scale Integration < 4,000 transistors) mask "artwork" was
hand-crafted on giant light tables by "rubylith cutters."
Semiconductor engineers like Federico Faggin would draw parts of the
layout on paper, trying to squeeze as much digital logic into a 3x4
millimeter rectange of silicon as they could. The rubylith cutters
turned engineering sketches into the carefully aligned, lithographic
masks that would be photo-reduced and used to fabricate (mass produce)
the actual semiconductor chips.

If you know any of these unsung heros, or were one yourself, please
[contact us](./contact). We'd love to hear your stories.

This is is an "X-ray" composite of two photomicrographs we used to
re-create the mask artwork: one with metal stripped away, exposing the
partially hidden polysilicon, diffusion, and buried contact layers.
The original, unstripped die photo, is "ghost" superimposed, making
the metal layer appear see-through, while still revealing the
underlying detail.

## Revision 2 of the 2010 Busicom 141-PF replica PCB

Bill Kotaska "beat us to the punch" with the replica he built in
2008, complete with a printer salvaged from another vintage
calculator. But still, in 2010, we wanted to make a PCB based replica
of our own using vintage chips: the original 4002s, 4003s, and 4004,
plus a 4201 clock generator, and a 4289 memory interface (so we could
use an old EPROM to replace the impossible-to-find, custom-programmed
4001s with the Busicom firmware... yes, not even on eBay). Now we are
working on Revision 2, with corrections and improvements.

Here is the first version that I designed, fabricated, and
assembled. Not quite working before my visit to Hungary in 2010, I
still I brought the prototype to Lajos Kintli as a gift, and after a
little PCB surgery and new printer emulator firmware, he brought
it to life (see printer output below).

## Shinshu-Seiki Model 102 printer emulator code

Lajos Kintli's printer emulator for the PIC18F2585 converts the
hammer signals to serial. This lets you view printer output from the
replica on a PC terminal window (as shown below) or on real hardware
using a small LCD panel with a serial input. The printer emulator is
also important simply to make the Busicom calculator software work at
all, by providing a "heartbeat" signal that was generated by the
spinning printer drum in the original.
