**Disclaimer**: To the best of my knowledge, the 4004 was manufactured from 1971 to 1986, an astonishing 15 year product lifespan. This claim is based on 1986 being the last date code I have seen on the "new old stock" electronics surplus market. This seems like pretty solid evidence to me, but it is entirely possible that my dates are off a bit. I welcome any documentation to the contrary.

# Why did the 4004 family last so long?

One can only speculate why it was manufactured for so many years, but unlike Intel's later microprocessors that required a printed circuit board full of chips to implement a complete computer, the 4004 family offered an elegant, scalable architecture that, in most cases, needed no "glue logic" (e.g. 7400 series decoders). The simplest of 4004-based designs can be build with just two chips, a 4004 CPU and a 4001 ROM. The 4001, besides providing 256 bytes of read-only program or data storage, has four I/O pins that can be individually factory-programmed to be either inputs or outputs. Add another 4001, and you get a total of eight I/O pins, etc. Similarly, each 4002 RAM provides four output pins in addition to its 40 bytes of read/write data storage. The 4004 can address up to 4k bytes of ROM and 640 bytes of RAM, small by modern-day standards but remarkable in its day.
