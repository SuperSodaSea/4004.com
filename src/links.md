# For More Information

The Intel Museum ([http://www.intel.com/museum/index.htm](http://www.intel.com/museum/index.htm)). This is where our exhibit is on display

The Computer History Museum ([http://www.computerhistory.org/](http://www.computerhistory.org/)) This is where I spoke on Monday 11/13/2006. They gave us access to an engineering prototype of the Busicom 141-PF calculator so we could extract the software from the ROMs.

Federico Faggin ([http://www.intel4004.com](http://www.intel4004.com)) Intel 4004 co-inventor and chip designer. He served as an advisor during the early stages of the museum project.

Masatoshi Shima ([http://www.v-t.co.jp/jp/support/column/shima_column_main.php](http://www.v-t.co.jp/jp/support/column/shima_column_main.php))
the only non-Intel co-inventor, working for Intel's client Busicom (aka NCM), he was the overall systems designer for the calculator, and he was a very significant contributor to the final 4004 architecture. He also wrote all the calculator software.

Fred Huettig ([http://www.starboarddesign.com/](http://www.starboarddesign.com/)) designed the electronics for the 4004 exhibit.

Brian Silverman ([http://www.picocricket.com/](http://www.picocricket.com/)) and his brother Barry Silverman reverse-engineered the 4004 from the schematics as well as the Busicom calculator software from the binaries.

Christian Bassow ([http://www.cpu-museum.com/](http://www.cpu-museum.com/)) collects chips and old calculators and runs a "virtual" CPU museum. He sent me photographs of the printed circuit board inside the Busicom calculator.

John Weinrich ([http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jsweinrich/](http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jsweinrich/)) built a 4004-based tic-tac-toe game. He sent me a bunch of the technical documentation on the 4004.

My MIT Media Lab web page ([http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~mcnerney](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/%7Emcnerney))

Prof. William Aspray ([http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/people/profiles.asp?u=waspray](http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/people/profiles.asp?u=waspray)) has researched the history of the 4004 extensively and conducted first-hand interviews with its inventors.
His [Masatoshi Shima oral history](http://www.ieeeghn.com/wiki/index.php/Masatoshi_Shima_Oral_History)
interview offers a Japanese perspective on the 4004 development.
Aspray's journal article ["The Intel 4004 Microprocessor: What Constituted Invention?"](http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/85.601727),
published in the
[*IEEE Annals of the History of Computing*, Vol. 19, No. 3 (1997)](http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/an/&toc=comp/mags/an/1997/03/a3toc.xml)
gives a great overview of the historical context and considers whether the birth of
the microprocessor was a revolutionary or evolutionary milestone in the
history of technology. [Unfortunately, this seminal article is
copyrighted, so I can't publish the PDF file here. You could buy it
from the IEEE for US$19, or you can see if your local college or
university library offers free access to the IEEE's digital archives.]
